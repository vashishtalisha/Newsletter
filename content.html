            <h2>NHRC issues notice over rescue of 23 child labourers in Saraswati Vihar.
            </h2>
            <p>New Delhi, Jul 9 (PTI) The NHRC said on Tuesday that it issued a notice to the Delhi government and the
                city's police commissioner over reports of 23 child labourers being rescued from the Northwest district.
                They were reportedly brought from nearby states and allegedly worked in various factories, the National
                Human Rights Commission (NHRC) said in a statement.
                A survey of Delhi is required to know if there are more industrial units where children are being
                engaged as labourers and what action has been taken against them, it said.
                The rights body took suo motu cognisance of a media report from July 5 that said 23 child labourers,
                including nine girls, were rescued from the Saraswati Vihar area.
                It observed that the content of the report, if true, raised a serious issue of violation of the rights
                of the children.
                The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act prohibits the employment of children under the age of
                14 in any capacity. The law also makes it a criminal offence to employ a child.
                Accordingly, the NHRC issued notices to the Delhi chief secretary and the police commissioner to submit
                a detailed report within two weeks.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The Northwest Delhi district magistrate has been directed to submit a report indicating the action
                taken, according to provisions of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, steps taken for
                their rehabilitation and reunion with their respective families as well as to continue their education,
                the commission said.
                The district magistrate is also expected to inform regarding legal action taken if any child labourer
                was being kept "under bondage", it added.
                Earlier, the commission came across such complaints or news reports that alleged violations of labour
                laws by owners of some factories running in the national capital. In view of this, the commission also
                sought to know about the action taken against such delinquent employers, the statement said.
                In a separate statement, the NHRC said it took suo motu cognisance of a media report from July 5,
                alleging that the infrastructure of a civil hospital in Jind in Haryana was in "poor condition".
                "There are 55 sanctioned posts of doctors in the hospital out of which only 19 posts are filled.
                Reportedly, about 2,000 patients visit the hospital daily. However, most of them are referred to other
                hospitals as it has neither proper medical equipment nor medicines. The monkey menace in the hospital
                has further added to their woes," the statement said.
                The commission observed the content of the news report, if true, raised a serious issue of violation of
                the right to health and medical care of the patients.
                Accordingly, it issued a notice to the Haryana chief secretary, seeking a detailed report within one
                week.
                The report is expected to include the steps taken or proposed to be taken to improve the overall
                condition of the Jind Civil Hospital so that patients can get medical care without any difficulty and
                are not referred to the other hospitals due to the non-availability of doctors and other necessary
                life-saving facilities, it said.

            <h2>Reduce tariffs on manufacturing inputs for electronics: ICEA
            </h2>
            <p>The Indian Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), which represents domestic electronics
                manufacturers, called on Tuesday for a reduction of import duties as a key Union budget demand. “With a
                sustained increase in production with the help of supportive policies, including the PLI, India now has
                entered a phase when the growth of the mobile phone sector depends not on domestic demand but on demand
                in the global market,”
                the ICEA said in a report prepared for the Finance Ministry.Pankaj Mohindroo, the ICEA’s President,
                argued against the relatively high tariffs India imposes on manufacturing inputs — China and Vietnam’s
                tariffs apply on fewer components and are of lower rates — saying that domestic component makers were
                increasing prices to just below the net prices of inputs to take advantage of the situation. “Global
                suppliers also consider the higher domestic price as their reference price in their negotiations with
                exporters because their imported inputs are duty-free for exports,” the ICEA report said.

                These tariffs, Mr. Mohindroo said, were compounded by customs authorities hindering orderly shipments of
                key components, likening the situation to an imported shirt being held back on account of higher duties
                on buttons.



            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p> Since much of the fresh production of phones in India is being exported, Mr. Mohindroo said, duties
                should be slashed to promote competitiveness of Indian assembly and manufacturing operations with the
                main other leaders in the sector, China and Vietnam. “Current high tariffs increase manufacturing costs
                in India by 7–7.5% on the bill of materials,” Mr. Mohindroo said. </p>

            <h2>Farmers seek hike in production incentive for paddy</h2>
            <p>Farmers’ organisations have pointed out that they have not reaped the full benefits of the MSP increases
                over the past four years. Each time the Central government raised the MSP, the State government reduced
                its own contribution.

                Sonichan Pulinkunnu, general secretary of the Paddy Farmers’ Protection Council in Kuttanad, says the
                previous Left Democratic Front government had promised a State production incentive of ₹9.52 per kg.
                Instead, over the past four years, this amount has been reduced to ₹6.37 per kg.

                Moreover, farmers are concerned about the stagnation of handling charges for paddy. These charges are
                intended to cover the costs associated with transporting paddy from fields and processing it into rice
                at Supplyco outlets.
                As the State government works to speed up the distribution of dues to paddy farmers in Kuttanad, the
                calls to raise State production incentives to match the new minimum support price (MSP) are now gaining
                momentum.


                At present, paddy farmers receive ₹28.12 per kg, which includes 12 paise for handling charges. Of this,
                ₹21.83 is the MSP set by the Centre. With the recent increase of ₹1.17 by the Central government,
                farmers should be entitled to ₹29.29 per kg, inclusive of handling charges.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>However, this increment is contingent upon the State government maintaining its current contribution of
                ₹6.37, plus the 12 paise handling charge.


                Farmers’ organisations have pointed out that they have not reaped the full benefits of the MSP increases
                over the past four years. Each time the Central government raised the MSP, the State government reduced
                its own contribution.

                Sonichan Pulinkunnu, general secretary of the Paddy Farmers’ Protection Council in Kuttanad, says the
                previous Left Democratic Front government had promised a State production incentive of ₹9.52 per kg.
                Instead, over the past four years, this amount has been reduced to ₹6.37 per kg.

                Moreover, farmers are concerned about the stagnation of handling charges for paddy. These charges are
                intended to cover the costs associated with transporting paddy from fields and processing it into rice
                at Supplyco outlets.


                In 2005-06, the handling charge was ₹45 per quintal, with farmers receiving ₹12 per quintal to help
                cover expenses. “Despite the Central government recently increasing these charges to ₹272 per quintal,
                the State government has not updated its contribution from the rate set 19 years ago,” says Mr.
                Pulinkunnu

                Flood situation worsens in Upper and North Kuttanad
            </h2>
            <p> Unprecedented severe floods, which affected Kerala during 2018 and 2019 submerged Kuttanad almost
                completely and the effects of these severe floods to following rice crop were studied. In these severe
                floods, the following rice crop puncha reflected a marked increase in yield mainly due to increase in
                soil fertility and less incidence of pests and diseases. In view of total rice production in the
                kuttanad region, severe floods have even a positive effect on rice production as the ground water table
                rose to facilitate water to the puncha crop. It was observed that there has been a notable variation in
                minimum temperature and relative humidity. All these factors contributed significantly to increase in
                rice yield. Floods are not always disastrous and can sometimes be advantageous as indicated by the post

                batter has threatened (except
                Brendon McCullum with 94 in 2017) to touch 100 sixes a year
                With India slated to play 12 more T20Is and Abhishek likely to be part of Punjab’s Syed Mushtaq Ali
                2024-25 Trophy campaign,
                the southpaw could end up having a hoard of at least 19 matches to tick off a whopping batting benchmark
                before New Year ‘25Two seasons of consistent runs and sixes across T20s – in the IPL and Syed Mushtaq
                Ali Trophy – have marked his exponential rise. Despite the presence of Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal
                in the T20I set-up, it would be difficult not to back and carry the abilities of Abhishek in the top
                order moving forward. Has he hit world-beating standards? He’s halfway there.</p>

        <div>
            <p>But the Zimbabweans and Harare pitch briefly forced Abhishek to operate in slow gears before accelerating
                spectacularly. The left-hander was on 27 off 23 deliveries before being dropped. The payback was hard as
                he cracked 72 off the next 23 balls (strike rate: 303). While he is the fastest Indian (in terms of
                innings) to get to a T20I hundred, Abhishek’s abilities to accelerate the pace of his knock and the
                six-hitting capacity stood out.

                Two seasons of consistent runs and sixes across T20s – in the IPL and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy – have

            <h2>The 35-minutes that revived England's Euro Championship campaign</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, a pause helps. Three minutes after Xavi Simons’s solo-run goal slipped England into
                pandemonium, Jude Bellingham suffered a blow on his head, colliding with Jerdy Schouten. But when the
                support staff attended to Bellingham, England’s Kieran Trippier, a warrior according to his coach,
                snarled at his teammates, exhorting them to pick the shattered pieces of their self-belief.

                He rushed to Declan Rice, from whom Simons had snatched the ball, and offered a warm embrace. He wrapped
                an arm of comfort around Phil Foden, whose struggles had embodied England’s passivity.

                Something suddenly stirred. The England that resumed after the break was a different animal, a beast
                that relentlessly tossed and ripped the Dutch stranglehold apart. England buzzed and fizzed into life,
                for 35 minutes of sustained and sweeping magnificence. The repelling parts finally fused and burned to
                produce carnage.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Two minutes on, Phil Foden composed a clever free-kick that Rice could have flicked towards the goal
                rather than passing back; Harry Kane would trap a ball on the turn and cracked a shot from 30 yards.
                Bukayo Saka, England’s most penetrative forward in the entire tournament, warped through the tight
                alleys into expansive spaces. He schemed the contentious Harry Kane penalty. He swanned into the box and
                took his shot, but the blocked attempt bounced to Kane. The VAR check, drama, the penalty and equaliser
                threw the game into the melodrama zone.

                It was even a kind of distraction, a disruption of England’s fluttering forwards. Kane regained his
                mobility, his pace and positioning instinct; Saka was a little globe of fire, swerving past the Dutch
                backline like a gust of breeze, cutting into his preferred inside right channels that lingering on the
                far right zones. It freed up space behind him, where Foden would slash in. The Manchester City forward
                has been the critics’ lightning rod for criticism, the finest example of Gareth Southgate’s capacity to
                stifle creative footballers.
